# Business_Diagrams_And_Documents
Portfolio where I showcase the application of Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams, use case diagrams, and entity-relationship diagrams to visualize software systems, interactions among system components, and database structures and relationships. 

I have also included the depiction of a user persona for performing business analysis and a business flyer to demonstrate my graphic design abilities.
